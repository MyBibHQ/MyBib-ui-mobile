# MyBib-ui-mobile

[MyBib](https://www.mybib.com) is a fast, free, and easy-to-use bibliography generator for the web (desktop, laptop, and mobile).

**MyBib-ui-mobile** is the web frontend component of MyBib, designed for users on mobile devices. It requires the server-side component [MyBib-core](https://github.com/mybibhq/mybib-core) to fully function.

We use Vue.js to keep things slick, including Vuex for state management. Muse UI for Material Design components, and Webpack to bring it all together.

## Build Setup
